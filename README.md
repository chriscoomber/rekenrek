# How to build

This demo uses *expo* to manage deployment. So, follow these instructions: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/, including installing the expo app on your mobile device if you wish to run on that device. Those instructions recommend installing yarn after you've installed npm with `npm install -global yarn`.

On your developer machine, in the console, navigate to the directory containing this README and run `yarn install`, which will install the dependencies mentioned in `package.json`.

Now you are ready to run the app. Simply open the expo app in your mobile device, and run on your development machine's console:

```
expo start
```

and follow the on-screen instructions to launch on your device, or in your browser.
