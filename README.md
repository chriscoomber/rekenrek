# How to build

This demo uses *expo* to manage deployment. So, follow these instructions: https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/installation/, including installing the expo app on your mobile device.

On your developer machine, in the console, navigate to the directory containing this README and run:

```
expo install
```

This will install the dependencies for the app to your computer (these are specified in package.json).

Now you are ready to run the app. Simply open the expo app in your mobile device, and run on your development machine's console:

```
expo start
```

and follow the on-screen instructions to launch on your device, or in your browser.
